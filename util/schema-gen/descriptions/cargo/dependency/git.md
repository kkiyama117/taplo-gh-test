To depend on a library located in a `git` repository, the minimum information
you need to specify is the location of the repository with the `git` key:

```toml
[dependencies]
rand = { git = "https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rand" }
```

Cargo will fetch the `git` repository at this location then look for a
`Cargo.toml` for the requested crate anywhere inside the `git` repository
(not necessarily at the root - for example, specifying a member crate name
of a workspace and setting `git` to the repository containing the workspace).

Since we havenâ€™t specified any other information, Cargo assumes that
we intend to use the latest commit on the main branch to build our package.
You can combine the `git` key with the `rev`, `tag`, or `branch` keys to
specify something else. Here's an example of specifying that you want to use
the latest commit on a branch named `next`:

```toml
[dependencies]
rand = { git = "https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rand", branch = "next" }
```

See [Git Authentication](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/appendix/git-authentication.html) for help with git authentication for private repos.

> **Note**: [crates.io](https://crates.io/) does not allow packages to be published with `git`
> dependencies (`git` [dev-dependencies](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/specifying-dependencies.html#development-dependencies) are ignored). See the [Multiple
> locations](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/specifying-dependencies.html#multiple-locations) section for a fallback alternative.
