The `crate-type` field defines the [crate types](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/linkage.html) that will be generated by the
target. It is an array of strings, allowing you to specify multiple crate
types for a single target. This can only be specified for libraries and
examples. Binaries, tests, and benchmarks are always the "bin" crate type.

The available options are `bin`, `lib`, `rlib`, `dylib`, `cdylib`,
`staticlib`, and `proc-macro`. You can read more about the different crate
types in the [Rust Reference Manual](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/linkage.html).
