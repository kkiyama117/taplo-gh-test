The `doctest` field indicates whether or not [documentation examples](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustdoc/documentation-tests.html) are
tested by default by [`cargo test`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo-test.html). This is only relevant for libraries, it
has no effect on other sections. The default is `true` for the library.
