The description is a short blurb about the package. [crates.io](https://crates.io) will display
this with your package. This should be plain text (not Markdown).

```toml
[package]
# ...
description = "A short description of my package"
```

> **Note**: [crates.io](https://crates.io) requires the `description` to be set.
