The `readme` field should be the path to a file in the package root (relative
to this `Cargo.toml`) that contains general information about the package.
This file will be transferred to the registry when you publish. [crates.io](https://crates.io)
will interpret it as Markdown and render it on the crate's page.

```toml
[package]
# ...
readme = "README.md"
```

If no value is specified for this field, and a file named `README.md`,
`README.txt` or `README` exists in the package root, then the name of that
file will be used. You can suppress this behavior by setting this field to
`false`. If the field is set to `true`, a default value of `README.md` will
be assumed.
