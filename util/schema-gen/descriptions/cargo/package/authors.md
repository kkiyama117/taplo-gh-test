The `authors` field lists people or organizations that are considered the
"authors" of the package. The exact meaning is open to interpretation â€” it may
list the original or primary authors, current maintainers, or owners of the
package. These names will be listed on the crate's page on
[crates.io](https://crates.io). An optional email address may be included within angled
brackets at the end of each author.

> **Note**: [crates.io](https://crates.io) requires at least one author to be listed.
