Cargo by default will warn about unused keys in `Cargo.toml` to assist in
detecting typos and such. The `package.metadata` table, however, is completely
ignored by Cargo and will not be warned about. This section can be used for
tools which would like to store package configuration in `Cargo.toml`. For
example:

```toml
[package]
name = "..."
# ...

# Metadata used when generating an Android APK, for example.
[package.metadata.android]
package-name = "my-awesome-android-app"
assets = "path/to/static"
```
